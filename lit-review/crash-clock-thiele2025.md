| CRASH Clock (4.8m-2.4m-10cm) | 701 days | 23 days | 30x worse |
| Close approaches < 1 km (all LEO) | every 3.9 min | every **36 seconds** | 6.5x |

## Key Equations

### Collision Rate (Equation 1)
```
Γ_sat = (1/2) ∫ n²_sat · A_col · v̄_r dV
```
- n_sat: number density (objects/km³) in altitude shell
- A_col: collision cross-section (m²)
- v̄_r = (4/3) v_orbital ≈ 10 km/s at 550 km (Equation 7)
- Factor 1/2 avoids double-counting same-population pairs

### Multi-Type Collision Rate (Equation 2)
```
Γ_h = v̄_r · V_h · Σ_{i,j≤i} (1 - δ_ij/2) · n_i · n_j · A^col_ij
```
- Separates debris, satellites, rocket bodies
- Different cross-sections per interaction type

### Collision Cross-Sections Used
| Interaction | Close Approach | Area (m²) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Satellite-Satellite | 10 m | 300 |
| Rocket Body-Satellite | 10 m | 300 |
| Satellite-Debris | 5 m | 79 |
| Debris-Debris | 10 cm | 0.03 |

Note: 300 m² is motivated by Starlink V2 mini's 29m solar panel span.
Average area (43 m²) vastly underestimates collision potential for elongated objects.

## Density Distribution (Figure 1)

- **550 km**: Starlink shell — highest density on orbit (n ≈ 2×10⁻⁷ km⁻³)
  - Over 10x denser than tracked debris peak at ~800 km
- **800 km**: Second peak — Fengyun 1C ASAT test (2007) + Iridium-Cosmos debris (2009)
- Shell of only 30 km thickness at 550 km → collision every ~11 days in that shell alone

## Critical Context

### Solar Storm Vulnerability
- May 2024 Gannon storm: nearly half of all LEO satellites maneuvered
- Positional uncertainties reached **several km** during storm
- Collision avoidance impossible when uncertainty > conjunction distance
- 1859 Carrington Event was **2x stronger** — would be catastrophic today
- CRASH Clock of 5.5 days = less than 1 week margin before potential collision

### Maneuver Cascade Problem
- Starlink: **144,404 avoidance maneuvers** in 6 months (Dec 2024 - May 2025)
- = 41 maneuvers per satellite per year
- = 1 collision avoidance maneuver every 1.8 minutes across constellation
- Each maneuver creates **up to 40 km** positional uncertainty afterward
- Maneuvers doubling every 6 months historically
- 2019: ESA forced to maneuver because SpaceX alert system had a **bug**

### Kessler-Cour-Palais Syndrome
- Altitudes above 600-800 km already above unstable threshold
- **Main Starlink shell (550 km) is also within the runaway threshold**
- Single collision could trigger long-term cascade (decades to centuries)
- Not Hollywood-style instant catastrophe — more like Exxon Valdez (slow degradation)

## N-body Simulation Details

- Code: **SatEvol** (Python, open source at github.com/norabolig/conjunctionSim)
- Physics: Keplerian + J2 precession, SGP4 for initial state propagation
- Conjunction detection: k-d tree search
- Time steps: 0.05s for 1 km threshold, **0.001s** for 100 m threshold
- Validation: Analytics and simulations agree within factor of 2
- First 3 hours of 2025 simulation: 30m debris-satellite conjunction occurred

## Gaps the Authors Identify

1. **Random orbit assumption**: Analytics assume uniform distribution within shells
   - Real constellations have structured phase configurations
   - Phase mixing time after loss of station-keeping is not characterized
2. **Inclination effects**: High densities at max latitude excursions not captured
3. **Temporal evolution**: Only snapshots, no launches/PMD/drag evolution
4. **Cross-section uncertainty**: Collision area depends on orientation, geometry
5. **No ML component**: Entirely analytical/simulation approach

## Implications for Panacea

### What the CRASH Clock Tells Us That CDM Models Miss

1. **Risks are systemic, not independent**
   - Current CDM-based ML (including our PI-TFT) treats each conjunction event independently
   - CRASH Clock shows collision rate scales as n² — density-dependent
   - A conjunction at 550 km is inherently riskier than one at 1200 km, regardless of CDM features

2. **Maneuver cascades create correlated uncertainty**
   - Satellite A maneuvers for conjunction C₁ → positional uncertainty increases
   - This uncertainty propagates to ALL future conjunctions involving satellite A
   - No ML model captures this cascade effect

3. **Environmental features are underexploited**
   - Space weather (F10.7, Kp, Dst) affects drag → affects positional uncertainty
   - Kelvins data HAS space weather columns (F10, AP, F3M, SSN) but they're weak predictors in isolation
   - Combined with shell density, they could be much more informative

4. **Real-time risk changes fundamentally during storms**
   - During solar storms, CRASH Clock effectively drops to hours
   - Current models don't condition on environmental state

### Novel ML Opportunities

| Opportunity | Novelty | Feasibility | Impact |
|-------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Shell density as CDM feature | High — no one has done this | Easy — compute from TLE catalog | Medium |
| Conjunction risk propagation graph | Very High — fundamentally new | Medium — needs graph architecture | Very High |
| Real-time CRASH Clock estimation | Medium — ML approximation of analytics | Easy — known ground truth | High (for demo) |
| Maneuver cascade prediction | Very High | Hard — requires maneuver history | Very High |
| Storm-conditioned risk adjustment | High | Medium — space weather data available | High |

### Key Takeaway for Our Project

The CRASH Clock paper provides the **theoretical framework** for why CDM-level
risk prediction is insufficient. The orbital environment is a coupled system where:
- Individual conjunction risk depends on population-level density
- Maneuver decisions for one event affect risk landscape for all others
- Environmental conditions (storms) can simultaneously degrade all predictions

**Our contribution**: Bridge the gap between population-level analytics (CRASH Clock)
and event-level prediction (CDM models) using graph-structured deep learning.
